# Annotate 2D Virtual Reality Images by Creating an Interactive WebVR scene

`r2vr` has been extended to be able to help train users to annotate virtual reality images more accurately. The 2D Testing will randomly select `3` images from a pool of images. Users are able to annotate selected markers (for each image) as either `C` or `N` to classify the bounded region as either containing mostly `Coral` or `Not Coral` respectively. The user will also be prompted to answer evaluation questions. The data generated from the 2d training and 2d testing can be read into R for analysis.

## Case Study: Coral Cover

```{r}

## TODO: SET full name here
# set_user("Firstname-Lastname") # default to be overridden

## OPTIONAL: '?set_marker_and_props' shows configuration options
# i.e. Number of markers and size of markers, but keep "2d"
set_marker_and_props("2d") 

## OPTIONAL: '?set_colors'
# set_colors(
#   marker = "#0000FF",
#   coral = "#FF00FF",
#   not_coral = "#FFFF00",
#   text = "#FFFFFF",

#   check_correct = "#00FFFF",

#   evaluation_selection = "#FF0000",
#   cursor = "#00FF00"
