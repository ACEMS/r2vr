# R objects for building A-Frame Scenes

The core of `r2vr` is 3 classes that map to A-Frame entities, assets, and
scenes. A scene may contain many child entities which may themselves contain
many child entities and assets. Entities may have many components added to define their behaviour.

Objects of these classes are defined using functions: `a_entity()`, `a_asset()`, `a_scene()`. 
Given a structure of these objects, `r2vr` does the work of:
* Rendering them as A-Frame HTML and combining into a selected HTML template. 
* Collecting their assets and required javascript sources and placing them in the appropriate HTML sections.
* Serving the HTML scene and asset files.

## Entities
In the A-Frame [entity-component architecture](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/entity-component-system.html) a scene is composed of entities. These are defined in HTML like:

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red"></a-entity>
```

Entities are customised using HTML element properties that map configuration to appearance and behaviour. A-Frame provides many 'convenience' tags to simplify the definition of commonly used entity configurations. For example the above entity can also be defined:

```html
<a-box color="red">
```

`r2vr` respects these same definition types. It provides the added convenience of defining component configuration as R lists. The above can be defined in R any of:

```r
a_entity(geometry = "primitive: box", material = "colour: red")
a_entity(geometry = list(primitve = "box"), material = list(color = "red"))
a_entity(tag = "box", color = "red")
```

Notice that entity components are attached using `...` arguments to the
`a_entity()` function. 

### Component Naming

For components with multi-word-names in A-Frame, the convention is to separate
with `-`, e.g. `wasd-controls`, when attaching these in `r2vr` you swap the `-`
for `_` since the dash is not legal as a bare symbol in R. So take this HTML:

```html
<a-camera wasd-controls="fly: true;"></a-camera>
```

Possible `r2vr` equivalents are:

```r
a_entity(tag="camera", wasd_controls = list(fly = TRUE))
a_entity(tag="camera", wasd_controls = "fly: true;")
```

One current issue is that you cannot supply an component without configuration
neatly. So to use `wasd-controls` with default configuration we must write
either:

```r
a_entity(tag="camera", wasd_controls="")
## or
a_entity(tag="camera", wasd_controls=NULL)
```

To require otherwise would mean cracking open the Non-Standard Evaluation can of
worms, a step not to be undertaken lightly.

### Nesting entities

In A-Frame entities can have child entities nested within them. This is often
extremely convenient to do since nested entities inherit the position and
rotation of their parent. So in this HTML:

```html
<a-box position="1 1 1", rotation="45 45 45" color="blue">
  <a-sphere position="1 0 0" color="green"></a-sphere>
</a-box>
```

The green sphere inherits `position` and `rotation` from its blue box parent.
It's own position is interpreted as offset from its parent. So the sphere's
absolute position is `2 1 1`.

In `r2vr` child entities are nested as a list supplied to the parent's
`children` argument. So the above pair are defined:

```r
a_entity(tag = "box", position = c(1, 1, 1), rotation = c(45, 45, 45), 
         color="blue",
         children = list(
           a_entity(tag = "sphere", positon = c(2, 1, 1))
         ))
```

Because the nested `a_entity` call returns an object it's possible to break up
the nesting a bit, if it aids readability:

```r
sphere <- a_entity(tag = "sphere", positon = c(2, 1, 1))

box <- a_entity(tag = "box", position = c(1, 1, 1),
                rotation = c(45, 45, 45),
                children = list(sphere))
```

## Attaching Custom Components

To use a custom component with an entity, a list of links to the component's
javascript sources can be passed to `a_entity` using the `js_sources` argument.
For an example let's crack open the source of `r2vr::a_json_model`, a
convenience entity for defining JSON models, which do not have native A-Frame
support:

```r
.extras_model_loader <- "https://cdn.rawgit.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/v4.0.2/dist/aframe-extras.loaders.js"


a_json_model <- function(src_asset, 
                         js_sources = list(.extras_model_loader), ...){
  a_entity(json_model = list(src = src_asset), js_sources = js_sources, ...)
}
```

So every `a_json_model()` is not much more than an `a_entity()` with a `json_model`
component attached along with a reference to the javascript that powers the
component. You do not have do worry about duplicate `js_sources` being added to
a scene. `r2vr` ensures only one reference to each unique javascript file makes
it into the final HTML.

Creating your own wrapper entities in this manner is also a way to simplify scene specification.

## Scene
A scene is the outer container for all entities. It's also an entity itself. Its
special powers are that it understands how to collate and serve a nested
structure of entity and asset objects. So just like a regular entity a scene can
have component configuration and nested children.

For example:

```html
<a-scene fog stats>
  <a-box position="1 1 1", rotation="45 45 45" color="blue">
    <a-sphere position="1 0 0" color="green"></a-sphere>
  </a-box>
</a-scene>
```

is defined in `r2vr` as:

```r
my_scene <- 
  a_scene(fog="", stats="",
          children = list(
            a_entity(tag = "box", position = c(1, 1, 1),
                     rotation = c(45, 45, 45),
                     children = list(
                       a_entity(tag = "sphere", positon = c(2, 1, 1))))))
```

### Scene templates
In `r2vr` scenes work with a HTML templating system. This allows you to reduce the complexity of scenes in R, by creating a template for the static parts that are not likely to change, E.g. ground, sky, lighting etc. Templates are selected using the `template` argument. Built-in templates at the moment are:

template name | description
---|---
`"empty"` | An empty scene. Will use default A-Frame lights and camera inserted by A-Frame. Defaults are removed if added to the scene configuration.
`"basic"` | Has a grid ground added. Will use default A-Frame lights and camera. Defaults are removed if added to scene configuration.
`"basic_map"` | Has a large grid ground, high point light source (A Sun) and high camera start position.V

A custom HTML file can be supplied as a `template`. The following placeholders are populated by the scene object:

placeholder | function
---|---
`${title}` | The title of the HTML page.
`${description}` | The meta description of the HTML page.
`${js_sources}` | Location in HTML `<head>` to place a list of `<script>` tags linking javascript sources files attached to scene children.
`${assets}` | Location to place a list of `<a-asset-item>` tags, one per line, generated from `a_assets` attached to scene children.
`${entities}` | Location to place a list of entity tags, one per line, indented as appropriate, generated from child entities.
`${scene_compnents}` | The space after the start of the `<a-scene >` tag to inject components attached to `a_scene()`.

### Serving and rendering scenes
A scene object can be called upon to render itself to HTML or serve itself to allow viewing in WebVR. Scenes are served using the [Fiery webserver framework](https://github.com/thomasp85/fiery).

Asumming `my_scene` is a reference to a scene object returned by `a_scene()` then the following actions are possible:

call | effect
---|---
`my_scene$serve(host = "127.0.0.1", port = 8080)` | Serve the Scene HTML as the root, "/", at the supplied IP address and port.
`my_scene$stop()` | Stop serving the scene.
`my_scene$render()` | A test/validaton helper: Return a string containing the complete scene HTML.
`my_scene$write("file.html")` | A test/validation helper: write the complete scene HTML to a file.

### Serving Assests and Linking Javascript files
Assests and Javascript sources are attached as arguments to components on entities or the scene itself. The scene collects the `id` fields and sources of all assets, and the links to all JS files and performs a de-duplication before rendering them in HTML.

It creates routes in the server for all unique assets. All local assets must be below the working directory from which `serve()`` is called.

## Assets
Assets are media like models, images, videos, sounds etc associated with A-Frame entities. In A-Frame HTML they are declared in a spcecial `<a-assets>` html block like this:

```html
<a-scene >
            <a-assets>
                <a-asset-item id="cube" src="./cube.json"></a-asset-item>
                <a-asset-item id="kangaroo" src="./Kangaroo_01.gltf"></a-asset-item>
            </a-assets>
            ...
```

The `id` property is referenced in entity component configuration where the asset is to be used like these two entities that render 3D models:

```html
 <a-entity json-model="src: #cube;" position="0 0 -2" scale="0.2 0.2 0"></a-entity>
 <a-gltf-model position="2 2 -3" src="#kangaroo"></a-gltf-model>
```

When using `r2vr` you don't have to worry about declaring assets in the `a-assets` block. That is taken care of automatically. The only concern is passing the `r2vr` asset object returned by `a_asset()` to the appropriate entity component.

### Example Asset Usage

#### Models
To define a scene containing JSON model and a glTF model, you can pass the asset objects to entities with json model and gltf model components:

```r
library(r2vr)
  ## Assest
  cube <- a_asset(id = "cube", src = "./cube.json")
  kangaroo <- a_asset(id = "kangaroo",
                      src = "./Kangaroo_01.gltf",
                      parts = "./Kangaroo_01.bin")

  ## Scene structure
  my_scene <- a_scene(template = "empty",
                      title = "A kangaroo and a cube.",
                      children = list(
                        a_json_model(src_asset = cube,
                                     position = c(-2,1,-5),
                                     scale = c(0.3, 0.3, 0.3)),
                          
                        a_entity(tag = "gltf-model",
                                 src = kangaroo,
                                 position = c(2, -1, -5),
                                 scale = c(0.3,0.3,0.3),
                                 rotation = c(0, 180, 0))
                          ))
```

that will allow you to serve HTML that looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>A kangaroo and a cube.</title>
    <meta name="description" content= "A kangaroo and a cube.">
    <script crossorigin src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.8.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/v4.0.2/dist/aframe-extras.loaders.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <a-scene >
            <a-assets>
                <a-asset-item id="cube" src="./cube.json"></a-asset-item>
                <a-asset-item id="kangaroo" src="./Kangaroo_01.gltf"></a-asset-item>
            </a-assets>
            
            <!-- Entities added in R -->
            <a-entity json-model="src: #cube;" position="-2 1 -5" scale="0.3 0.3 0.3"></a-entity>
            <a-gltf-model src="#kangaroo" position="2 -1 -5" scale="0.3 0.3 0.3" rotation="0 180 0"></a-gltf-model>
            

        </a-scene>
    </body>
</html>
```

And renders like this:

#### Texture Images
Adding images as textures is another useful application. Image assets use the plain HTML `<img>` tag instead of `<a-asset-item>`. Here's an example that builds a VR scene around an R plot image:

```r
## libs
library(r2vr)
library(visdat)
library(ggplot2)

## making an image
## powers of 2 are good since they need less rescaling.
png("VRisdat.png", width = 512, height = 512)
p <- vis_dat(airquality)
p + theme_light(base_size = 13)
dev.off()

## creating a thematic background using 'environment'
## https://github.com/feiss/aframe-environment-component
backdrop <- a_entity(environment = list(preset= "tron", dressingAmount = 40,
                                        playArea = 0), 
                     js_sources = "https://rawgit.com/feiss/aframe-environment-component/master/dist/aframe-environment-component.min.js")

## rendering the image on a canvas
visdat_plot <- a_asset(tag = "img", id = "vrisdat", src = "VRisdat.png")

canvas <- a_entity(tag = "plane", position = c(0, 10, -10), height = 20, width = 20,
          src = visdat_plot)

my_scene <- a_scene(title = "A VR ggplot",
                    template = "empty",
                    children = list(backdrop, canvas))
                    
my_scene$serve()

## my_scene$stop()

```
Which creates this scene:
