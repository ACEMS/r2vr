# Annotate 3D Virtual Reality Images by Creating an Interactive WebVR scene

`r2vr` has been extended to be able to help train users to annotate virtual reality images more accurately. The 3D Testing will randomly select `3` images from a pool of images. Users are able to annotate selected markers (for each image) as either `C` or `N` to classify the bounded region as either containing mostly `Coral` or `Not Coral` respectively. The user will also be prompted to answer evaluation questions. The data generated from the 3d training and 3d testing can be read into R for analysis.

## Case Study: Coral Cover

```{r}
library(r2vr)

IPv4_ADDRESS <- find_IP() # Note: If not on Windows, enter IP directly

## TODO: SET full name here
# set_user("Firstname-Lastname") # default to be overridden
set_user("Jon-Peppinck")

## OPTIONAL: '?set_marker_and_props' shows configuration options
# i.e. Number of markers and size of markers, but keep "3d"
set_marker_and_props("3d") 

## OPTIONAL: '?set_colors'
set_colors()

# NOTE: If have other local images on PC can change img_paths to be a vector of relative file location for the current working directory
