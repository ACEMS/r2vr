\details{
This function creates an object that represents an A-Frame scene. A scene is
a special type of A-Frame entity that is the root entity of the WebVR scene.
Like regular entities it can have components added to it that change its
behaviour.

A scene has a html representation that is based off a template supplied in
the `template` argument. The template is a partially filled out A-Frame html
that contains some Javascript js_sources, and potentially some convenient
entities. Included templates are:
    * 'basic' Scene which is empty but for a 10m x 10m grid for ground.
    Default lights are injected by A-Frame.
    * 'basic_map' As per basic but camera position starts higher, and WASD
    movement controls are added. A bright light is situated high in the sky.
    * 'empty' an empty scene. Default lights are injected by A-Frame.
The built-in templates are intended for debugging/construction purposes. Use
'empty' for real scenes or build your own template.

A scene can render itself and all its child entities and assets to a single
html file that defines a WebVR scene that can be viewed in a browser. In
addition to this a scene can also be called upon to serve itself so that it
can be viewed immediately.

Scene components are expressed as ... arguments passed to this function.

Child entities are passed as list in the `children` argument.
